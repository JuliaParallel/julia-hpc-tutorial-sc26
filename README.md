# The Julia for HPC Tutorial at SC26

- **When**: Monday, 16 November 2026, 8:30am - 5:00pm CST, full day
- **Where** W185d
- **Conference info** = [SC26 event webpage](https://sc26.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=tut134&sess=sess169)
- **Handouts slides** = [Julia for HPC SC26 Handouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aSHfJ3gi_FW_oQfeNJW-yE_Q4PiTQUfh/view?usp=sharing) 

Welcome to the Julia for High-performance Computing (HPC) Tutorial at SC26 in Chicago, IL! This **full-day, 6-hour hands-on** tutorial introduces participants to using the Julia programming language effectively in HPC environments, from first principles to end-to-end deployment on a leadership-class system.
Registered participants: please look at the end of this file for access to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory [Odo system](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/odo_user_guide.html) (32 nodes of Frontier, each node has 8 AMD MI250X GPUs). 

## Audience Target

- Those familiar with a programming language that want to learn more about Julia.
- Those without previous HPC familiarity. In fact, Julia is a great introductory language for HPC.
- Those interested in how Julia can help them go from idea to deploy at large scale on HPC systems - all in one language.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to the Julia language and ecosystem for high-productivity
- Vendor-neutral parallel computing in Julia, intra-node: [KernelAbstractions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl), [JACC.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/JACC.jl), inter-node: [MPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl), [Dagger.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/Dagger.jl)
- Running and profiling a Julia application, the Gray-Scott diffusion-reaction partial differential equation solver on a HPC Cluster (CPU and GPU).
